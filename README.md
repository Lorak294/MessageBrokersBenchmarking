# Message Queue Benchmarking

A distributed benchmarking platform for comparing **Apache Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, and **PGMQ** across throughput and end-to-end latency, using three communication patterns.

## Overview

This platform measures how different message brokers perform under controlled conditions. It uses a centralized orchestrator coordinating multiple worker processes over SignalR, allowing scalable distributed tests with precise timestamp-based latency measurement.

Brokers, workers and orchestrattor are constrained to fixed resources (CPU/memory) to ensure fair comparisons.

```

The orchestrator is **broker-agnostic** — it generates logical targets like `"group_0"`, `"group_1"`. Each broker implementation translates these to concrete infrastructure (topics, queues, exchanges, routing keys) via static naming classes (`KafkaNaming`, `RabbitMqNaming`, `PgMqNaming`). Infrastructure names are never specified in config.

### Test Lifecycle

1. **Initialize** — HTTP `POST /api/benchmarking/initialize` with test config JSON
2. **Janitor** — One worker prepares broker infrastructure (create/purge topics, queues, exchanges)
3. **Role Assignment** — Orchestrator assigns remaining workers as producers or consumers, sends configs (including routing plans for producers and group names for consumers)
4. **Start** — HTTP `POST /api/benchmarking/start` triggers `StartTest` signal
5. **Produce** — Producers send messages according to routing plan, round-robin across targets (optionally rate-limited), recording send timestamps
6. **ProducersDone** — Orchestrator signals consumers that all messages have been sent
7. **Drain** — Consumers continue receiving until idle timeout expires (`consumerIdleTimeoutSeconds`)
8. **Results** — Workers submit compressed timestamp batches; orchestrator computes per-group metrics and returns CSV

## Communication Modes

|                  | PointToPoint | PubSub | Streaming |
|------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Kafka**        | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **RabbitMQ**     | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **PGMQ**         | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### PointToPoint

Each consumer group receives a **distinct subset** of messages. The producer round-robins messages across groups according to a routing plan.

- Use `messagesPerConsumerGroup` to specify how many messages each group receives (e.g., `[5000, 3000]`). If omitted, `messageCount` is divided equally across groups.
- Consumer groups have **competing consumers** — multiple consumers within a group share the work.

| Broker | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Kafka | Separate topic per group (`benchmark_group_0`, `benchmark_group_1`). Consumers in a group share a consumer group ID. |
| RabbitMQ | Topic exchange (`benchmark_topic`) with routing keys per group. Each group binds its queue to its routing key. |
| PGMQ | Topic routing per group. Each group has its own queue with a routing key subscription. |

### PubSub

Every message is delivered to **all consumer groups**. Each group independently receives the full message stream.

- Use `messageCount` to specify total messages produced (each group receives all of them).
- Consumer groups have **competing consumers** within each group.

| Broker | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Kafka | Shared topic (`benchmark`). Each group gets a unique `group.id`, so Kafka delivers all messages to every group independently. |
| RabbitMQ | Fanout exchange (`benchmark_fanout`). Each group has its own queue bound to the exchange. |
| PGMQ | Broadcast routing key. All group queues subscribe to the broadcast key, each receiving a copy. |

### Streaming

Each consumer group independently reads from the **same persistent log** using offset-based consumption.

- Use `messageCount` to specify total messages produced (each group reads all of them).
- **RabbitMQ and PGMQ**: Only 1 consumer per group is allowed (no competing consumers on streams). Configs with >1 consumer per group are rejected at validation.
- **Kafka**: Multiple consumers per group are allowed (Kafka natively supports competing consumers on partitions).

| Broker | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Kafka | Shared topic with unique `group.id` per group. Standard consumer group semantics with partition assignment. |
| RabbitMQ | Stream queue (`benchmark_stream`). Each consumer reads independently with its own offset. |
| PGMQ | Stream queue (`benchmark_stream`). Offset-based reads — each consumer tracks its own read position. |

## Latency Measurement

Timestamps are recorded in the worker process:

- **Producer**: `DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks` captured **before** `SendAsync` — includes any buffering/batching time, which reflects real application-perceived latency
- **Consumer**: `DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks` captured in the message handler upon receipt

End-to-end latency = consumer timestamp − producer timestamp. This measures the full path: client buffer → broker → delivery to consumer.

Results are aggregated **per consumer group**, with accurate `messagesLost` calculation based on expected messages for each group (not total sent).

## Configuration

Test configs are JSON files passed to the `/api/benchmarking/initialize` endpoint. Infrastructure names (queue names, exchange names, topic names, group IDs, routing keys) are **auto-generated** — only connection details and performance tuning knobs are configured.

### PointToPoint Example

```json
{
  "producersCount": 1,
  "consumerGroups": [2, 1],
  "communicationMode": "PointToPoint",
  "messagesPerConsumerGroup": [5000, 3000],
  "messageSizeInBytes": 256,
  "sendFrequencyMps": 5000,
  "mqConfig": {
    "implementation": "Kafka",
    "additionalSettings": {
      "bootstrapServers": "kafka:9092",
      "lingerMs": "5",
      "batchSize": "65536",
      "useBufferedProducer": "true"
    }
  }
}
```

### PubSub / Streaming Example

```json
{
  "producersCount": 2,
  "consumerGroups": [2, 2],
  "communicationMode": "PubSub",
  "messageCount": 10000,
  "messageSizeInBytes": 256,
  "sendFrequencyMps": 5000,
  "mqConfig": {
    "implementation": "RabbitMQ",
    "additionalSettings": {
      "hostname": "rabbitmq",
      "port": "5672",
      "username": "guest",
      "password": "guest",
      "prefetchCount": "200",
      "durableMode": "false",
      "publisherConfirms": "false"
    }
  }
}
```

### Top-Level Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `producersCount` | Number of workers assigned as producers |
| `consumerGroups` | Array where each element is the consumer count for that group, e.g. `[2, 3]` |
| `communicationMode` | `PointToPoint`, `PubSub`, or `Streaming` |
| `messageCount` | Total messages to produce (used for PubSub/Streaming; optional for PointToPoint if `messagesPerConsumerGroup` is set) |
| `messagesPerConsumerGroup` | Per-group message counts for PointToPoint (e.g. `[5000, 3000]`). If omitted, `messageCount` is split equally. Ignored for PubSub/Streaming. |
| `messageSizeInBytes` | Payload size per message |
| `sendFrequencyMps` | Optional rate limit in messages/second (omit for max throughput) |

### Broker-Specific Settings (`additionalSettings`)

**Kafka**: `bootstrapServers`, `lingerMs`, `batchSize`, `useBufferedProducer`

**RabbitMQ**: `hostname`, `port`, `username`, `password`, `durableMode`, `prefetchCount`, `publisherConfirms`

**PGMQ**: `connectionString`, `visibilityTimeout`, `queueMode`, `messageReadMode`, `consumerMode`, `pollIntervalMs`, `maxPollSeconds`, `notifyThrottleMs`, `usePop`, `useBufferedProducer`, `producerBatchSize`, `producerLingerMs`, `consumerBatchSize`

## Running

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose

### Start a Benchmark

```bash
# Start infrastructure + workers (e.g. Kafka with 6 workers)
docker compose --profile kafka up --build --scale worker=6

# Initialize a test
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/benchmarking/initialize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @example-configurations/kafka-p2p.json

# Run the test (blocks until complete, returns results)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/benchmarking/start
```

Available profiles: `kafka`, `rabbitmq`, `pgmq`. Scale workers to at least `producersCount + sum(consumerGroups) + 1` (the extra one is the janitor).

### Check Connected Workers

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/benchmarking/workers
```

## Example Configs

The `example-configurations/` directory contains configs for all broker/mode combinations:

| Config | Mode | Broker |
|--------|------|--------|
| `kafka-p2p.json` | PointToPoint | Kafka |
| `kafka-pubsub-streaming.json` | PubSub | Kafka |
| `rabbitmq-p2p.json` | PointToPoint | RabbitMQ |
| `rabbitmq-pubsub.json` | PubSub | RabbitMQ |
| `rabbitmq-streaming.json` | Streaming | RabbitMQ |
| `pgmq-p2p.json` | PointToPoint | PGMQ |
| `pgmq-pubsub.json` | PubSub | PGMQ |
| `pgmq-streaming.json` | Streaming | PGMQ |

## Result Analysis

The `result-analysis/` directory contains a Python tool for visualizing benchmark results:

```bash
cd result-analysis
pip install -e .
python main.py --mode all
```

Generates:
- Throughput bar charts (msg/s and MB/s) grouped by message size
- Latency-over-time smoothed line plots
- Latency distribution plots (KDE on log scale)
- Comparison tables (avg, median, P50, P95, P99)

Results are read from `result-sets/` (organized as `{test-type}/{group}/{broker}/results.csv`) and output to `output/`.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Auto-generated infrastructure names** — Queue names, exchange names, topic names, group IDs, and routing keys are generated by static `*Naming` classes in each broker implementation. Config only contains connection details and tuning knobs.
- **Broker-agnostic orchestrator** — The orchestrator works with logical group names (`group_0`, `group_1`) and routing plans. Broker implementations translate these to concrete infrastructure.
- **Routing plans for PointToPoint** — The orchestrator generates a `RoutingPlan` that maps each logical group target to a message count. Producers round-robin across targets using `RoundRobinRoutingIterator`. When multiple producers exist, the plan is split proportionally via `TestScheduler.SplitRoutingPlan`.
- **Per-group metrics** — Results (including `messagesLost`) are calculated per consumer group against expected counts, not against total messages sent.
- **Kafka buffered producer** with queue-full backpressure — `Produce()` with retry on `Local_QueueFull` for high throughput without hanging
- **RabbitMQ publisher confirms** — optional config to ensure `BasicPublishAsync` blocks until broker confirms, giving accurate durable-mode latency
- **PGMQ batch operations** — `send_batch()` and batch pop/read/delete to minimize round-trips
- **Consumer stop via idle timeout** — consumers don't know total message count; they drain until no messages arrive for 10 seconds (hardcoded constant)
- **Janitor phase** — dedicated pre-test cleanup ensures consistent starting state across runs
- **Rate limiting** — hybrid sleep + spin-wait (`RateLimiter`) for precise send frequency control
- **Custom PGMQ client** — wraps raw SQL calls to `pgmq.*` functions rather than using an external library, enabling full control over batch APIs and topic operations
